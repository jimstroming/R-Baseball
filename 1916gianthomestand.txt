The Indians winning streak this year has been exciting.  One side effect of the 
winning streak is discussion of the 1916 Giants 26 game winning streak.
While most discussion has been about the tie that happened during the streak, a 
more interesting fact to me is that the 26 game winning streak happened
during a 31 game homestand, and they earlier lost 17 consecutive games, all on 
the road.  Why did the Giants have such a long homestand and roadtrip?
