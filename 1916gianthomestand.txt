The Indians winning streak this year has been exciting.  One side effect of the 
winning streak is discussion of the 1916 Giants 26 game winning streak.
While most discussion has been about the tie that happened during the streak, a 
more interesting fact to me is that the 26 game winning streak happened
during a 31 game homestand, and that the Giants earlier won 17 consecutive games, all on 
the road.  Why did the Giants have such a long homestand and roadtrip?

My first thought was, maybe the Polo Grounds, the Giants home stadium was
undergoing renovation early in the year.  But I see no evidence of that online.
Wikipedia does give an interesting fact:  that the Yankees played in the Polo
Grounds from 1913-1922, when they built Yankee Stadium.  Are the long homestands
and road trips a side effect of two teams sharing a stadium in the era of hand
scheduling without computers?


According to baseball-reference.com
The Giants had a 21 game roadtrip from May 9 to June 1 containing the 17 games winning streak.
13 game homestand followed by
6 game roadtrip followed by
8 game homestand
18 game roadtrip
17 game homestand
22 game roadtrip
31 game homestand
 4 game roadtrip
 
 What did the Yankees 1916 schedule look like?
21 game homestand from May 9 to June 1
16 game roadtrip
 6 game homestand
 8 game roadtrip
 .

 .
22 game roadtrip 
 
 
 What about the 1916 Cubs, for example?
Their longest was a 17 game homestand, 21 game roadtrip
 
1916 White Sox?
23 game homestand, 21 game roadtrip.

How does this compare against modern teams?

2016 White Sox
10 game homestand,  9 game roadtrip.

So it doesn't seem specific to the Yankees and Giants.
Is it the difference between air travel and train travel?
Or is it something the more players' union negotiated.


From an article on mlb.com,   http://m.mlb.com/news/article/1383448//
where Katy Feeney described scheduling

"Requirements such as these need to be juggled with Feeney's regular wish list: 
No four-series homestands or road trips; a minimum of "semi-repeaters," 
those home-and-home series between teams interrupted by only one other series; 
fair distribution of the 13 in-season weekends among each team's 81-game home 
schedule."

So nothing conclusive yet, but still leaning toward air travel and better
treatment of players overall.
