The White Sox playoff chances are not good.  Fangraph puts their chances at 0%, which is technically not true.

The White Sox lost to Kansas City Monday afternoon for the third straight time, which has almost ended their chances.
The Sox now have a maximum of 84 wins.  The second wildcard will require at least 82 wins.
Baltimore's loss to the Red Sox keeps the second wildcard number at 82 wins for now,
thought Houston's win has put pressure on that number, lifting Houston to 81 wins in the White Sox
best case scenario.
The White Sox also need Toronto to continue beating Seattle and then the other wildcard teams.
