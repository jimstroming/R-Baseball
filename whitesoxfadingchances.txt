The White Sox playoff chances are not good.  Fangraph puts their chances at 0%, which is technically not true.

By not playing the White Sox survive: Baltimore lost. The Yankees lost. Houston lost.
But, Detroit swept a double header, putting them into wild card position,  which means
the White Sox only chance is a highly unlikely 6-way tie for the 2nd wildcard.

Tomorrow, the White Sox will be eliminated with a Detroit win, Baltimore win, Houston win, 
Seattle win, Yankee win, or, of course, if the White Sox do not win and end their five game losing streak.
